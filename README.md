t.gen_text(text="Hello World!", row_num=1)
t.gen_text(text="With \x1b[32mANSI\x1b[0m escape sequence support!", row_num=2)
github_stats = gifos.utils.fetch_github_stats(
    user_name="x0rzavi"
)  # needs GITHUB_TOKEN in .env or as environment variable
t.delete_row(row_num=1)
t.gen_text(text=f"GitHub Name: {github_stats.account_name}", row_num=1, contin=True)
